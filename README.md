# hello-world
this is my first git hub repository, used for the stupid hello world tutorial plus I'll play around and add a bunch of other junk
I am not a coder, so am curious as to why I need to learn a code repository. 
Blah blah blah blah
I am making these changes because the tutorial told me to do so but I'm not sure what the point is yet.  Good luck figuring all the crap out on the internet.
